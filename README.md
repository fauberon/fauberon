- 👋 Hi, I’m @fauberon
- 👀 I’m interested in serverless efficient apps, and in building applciatins from the ground with the less automation or frameworks. Vanilla JavaScript will rule the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nodejs for serverless Azure functions, some day with typescript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on odata and msal authentication
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure. I'm not very active.
